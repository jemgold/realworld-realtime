# Realworld, Realtime

This is my totally rad demo of wrapping [rwldrn/johnny-five](https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five) for use in Meteor.js apps.

I haven't had time to make a schematic yet, but you just want an Arduino Uno loaded with Firmata, and these things in the right pins:
#7 - big red push button
#11 - LED
A3 - potentiometer

Funtimes.
